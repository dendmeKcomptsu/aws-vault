## What are the critics saying about LoveShhuda?
 
LoveShhuda received mostly negative reviews from the critics who found the film to be boring, predictable and poorly executed. The film was criticized for its weak script, direction, acting and lack of chemistry between the lead pair. The film was also accused of being a rip-off of Hollywood films like The Hangover and Bollywood films like Pyaar Ka Punchnama.
 
Here are some of the critic reviews of LoveShhuda:

> "The whole 'not being able to remember what I did in my drunken state,' and reliving the scenario the next morning has no dÃ©jÃ  vu. Instead, itâs a terrible mishmash of nothingness. Also for a romantic film to go boom, there should be real passion between its lead players. Individually the boy and the girl arenât too bad but where is the chemistry between you, guys?" - Meena Iyer, Times of India

> "Why did Girish Kumar even think he needed another chance at acting after Ramaiya Vastavaiya. He canât dance, he canât act and unfortunately his bare body too is not enticing enough. Navneet Kaur Dhillon makes her debut with this film. She is styled good enough but weak in the acting department." - Surabhi Redkar, Koimoi

> "The story is null. Screenplay is dull. Nothing is in the name of dialogues. First half is directly lift up from 'Hangover' in childish way...Showing sad and happy faces for a moment of a person can reflect the life journey of that person!? This is used as metaphor. Sorry to say but makers have some alienating type of sensitivity." - dineshprakash, IMDb

LoveShhuda failed to impress the critics and the audience alike. The film was a box office flop and received a rating of 4.7/10 on IMDb and 2/5 on Times of India.
