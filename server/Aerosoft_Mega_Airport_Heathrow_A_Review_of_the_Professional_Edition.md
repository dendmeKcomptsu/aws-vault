## Comparison with Other Products
 
There are other products on the market that offer simulation scenery for London Heathrow Airport. Some of them are:

- UK2000 Heathrow Xtreme: This product is a cheaper alternative to Aerosoft's Mega Airport Heathrow Professional, but it lacks some of the features and quality that Aerosoft offers. For example, it does not include the new T2 and T2B terminals, it has lower resolution textures and models, it does not support SODE jetways or dynamic traffic, and it has less realistic lighting and shadows.
- Orbx TrueEarth Great Britain South: This product is a comprehensive scenery package that covers the entire southern part of Great Britain, including London Heathrow Airport. It offers high-quality aerial images, 3D buildings, landmarks, vegetation, roads, railways, waterways, and more. However, it does not focus on London Heathrow Airport specifically, so it does not offer as much detail or accuracy as Aerosoft's Mega Airport Heathrow Professional. It also requires a lot of disk space and system resources to run smoothly.
- FlyTampa Amsterdam: This product is 0f148eb4a0
