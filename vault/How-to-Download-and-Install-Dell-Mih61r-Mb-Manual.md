If you don't know these information, you can use the [product identifier tool](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/product-identifier) to find them.
2. Select your product from the list of results and click on "Manuals and Documents". You will see a list of available manuals in different languages and formats.
3. Choose the manual that matches your needs and click on "Download File". You will need a PDF reader to open the manual.
